# computingPi
This project is a haskell program that computes digits of pi.  
The computation is done using Machin's formula which can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machin-like_formula
The program is not optimized, nor is it exceptionally fast.
The file pi1000000.txt contains the first million digits of pi which are intended to be used to verify results.

To compute (for example) 1000 digits of pi, run as follows:
`pi 1000 < pi1000000.txt`
