The goals of this project are:
- To create a benchmarking tool
- To learn how haskell performs on different machines and in the browser.
- Possibly to compare different haskell -> javascript compilers.
- To try out optimization flags.
- To write a fun/educational pi calculator in haskell.
- to provide a web based interface to the pi calculator ( possibly in react ).
- to allow for the option of running in the browser or on a server.
